# Modern UI handles dynamic data

## Angular / Vue

```
data <-> object <-> view
```

`view = markup + event listener`

## React

```
view = fn(data)
```

```
initialView = fn(initialData)

// when data change
updatedView = fn(changedData)

// data changes again
latestView = fn(latestData)
```

- Everytime data change, you generate the desired view that you want to have with that data
- The desired view is provided to React, and React will compare with previous view and find the difference between them and do the minimal operation on DOM
